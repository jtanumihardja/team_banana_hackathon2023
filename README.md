# Creating and Using MapBox Access Token for Geocoding API

1) Go to: <a href="https://www.mapbox.com/">https://www.mapbox.com/</a> and sign
in to your account or sign up for one.

2) Go to the "Dashboard" or "Tokens" page and click "Create a token".

3) Enter a name for your token in the "name" box.

4) Scroll down and click "Create Token". (The default token scopes work fine for
the Geofetch API)

5) Copy the newly created Token and assign it to the
`MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN = "<Place_Your_MapBox_Access_Token_Here>";` on line 1 of `main.js`.

6) Save and open or refresh `index.html` and it should work.

7) Go bananas üçå! ;)
